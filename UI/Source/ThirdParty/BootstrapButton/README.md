# Bootstrap button 

This is a wrapper for Bootstrap buttons, including the modular SASS source available from [www.getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/download/).  The styling is comprised of:

* `BootstrapButton.40.scss` - the stcok styling from Bootstrap 5.1.2
* `BootstrapButton.50.scss` - SocialStack-specific overrides which ensure buttons use our theming CSS vars

> **Please note**: previously available as `UI/Button` which unfortunately suffered from permissions issues. `UI/BootstrapButton`should now be used
