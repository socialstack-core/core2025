 * cross-browser line clamping support

 * example usage:
 *
 * <p data-clamp="3">Content will be limited to 3 lines</p>
 *
 * <p data-clamp="2" data-clamp-md="3" data-clamp-xl="0">
 *   This content will be limited to 2 lines, up until the screen width reaches $data_clamp_breakpoints['md'],
 *   whereupon content will be limited to 3 lines.  Once $data_clamp_breakpoints['xl'] is reached, line clamping
 *   will be disabled (display reset to block by default)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p data-clamp-sm="4" data-clamp-lg="0" data-clamp-display="flex">
 *   This content will be not be limited below $data_clamp_breakpoints['sm']; after this, it will be limited to 4 lines.
 *   Once $data_clamp_breakpoints['xl'] is reached, line clamping will be disabled and display will be reset to "flex"
