		/// 
		/// If your locator does specify a primary page but does not specify the content ID (i.e. it's pointing at general use primary page) then your Url must contain an ${type.id} token.
		/// For example, /users/${user.id} targeting "primary:user"
		/// /users/${user.id} targeting "page:42" which in turn has a key of "primary:user"
		/// Essentially when the ID is not known, it will be resolved from an ID token. If you want a fancier URL with a slug etc, then you must generate that as a dedicated permalink.
